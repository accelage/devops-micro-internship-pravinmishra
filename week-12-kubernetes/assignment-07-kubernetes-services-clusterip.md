# Assignment 7 — Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will create and test a Kubernetes ClusterIP Service. You will connect it to a healthy NGINX Deployment, access it using DNS and its ClusterIP, break and restore its selector, and observe how readiness affects Service routing.

---

# Task 0 — Prepare the Lab Environment

## Goal

Confirm your learning-cluster context and remove previous lab resources where applicable before starting this assignment.

No screenshot or written notes are required for this pre-check.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up Your Lab Directory

## Goal

Create and enter a dedicated directory for the ClusterIP Service lab.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing that you are working inside `~/k8s-labs/services/clusterip`

---

### Notes

**1. Why is it not reliable to communicate with an application using a Pod IP address?**

Pod IP addresses are temporal, ephemeral and change whenever a Pod is restarted, scaled, updated, or rescheduled.

**2. What Kubernetes resource provides a stable internal address for a group of Pods?**

Kubernetes Services

---

# Task 2 — Create a Healthy NGINX Deployment

## Goal

Create an NGINX Deployment with labels, readiness probes, and liveness probes that can act as the backend for a Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Completed `00-nginx-deploy.yaml` manifest

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output showing successful rollout and two ready NGINX Pods

![](screenshots/Ass7sc3.JPG)

---

### Notes

**1. Which label will the Service use to find these Pods?**

app: nginx

**2. Why is readiness important before connecting Pods to a Service?**

It ensures that traffic is only routed to Pods that are fully initialized and capable of serving requests.

**3. What port does the NGINX container listen on?**

Port 80

---

# Task 3 — Create a ClusterIP Service

## Goal

Create a stable internal Service that routes traffic to the NGINX Pods.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Completed `01-nginx-svc-clusterip.yaml` manifest

![](screenshots/Ass7sc4.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output showing the ClusterIP Service, endpoints, or EndpointSlices

![](screenshots/Ass7sc5.JPG)

---

### Notes

**1. What is the purpose of a ClusterIP Service?**

It provides a stable internal IP address and load balancing across a set of Pods within the cluster.

**2. What is the difference between `port` and `targetPort`?**

port is the virtual port exposed by the Service itself, while targetPort is the port on the backend Pod container where traffic is forwarded.

**3. Why must the Service selector match the Pod labels?**

The Service uses the selector labels to dynamically discover and route traffic to the correct Pods

**4. What information do EndpointSlices contain?**

They contain backend Pod IP addresses, network ports, and readiness conditions.

---

# Task 4 — Access the Service from Inside the Cluster

## Goal

Create a client Pod and access the NGINX Service using DNS and its ClusterIP.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Output showing the `tester` Pod running

![](screenshots/Ass7sc6.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful Service request using DNS name and ClusterIP

![](screenshots/Ass7sc7.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Successful DNS lookup for the Service

![](screenshots/Ass7sc8.JPG)

---

### Notes

**1. Why should an application use `nginx-svc` instead of a Pod IP address?**

It is because nginx-svc provides a stable address that persists even when backend Pod IPs change.

**2. What does the DNS name `nginx-svc.default.svc.cluster.local` represent?**

The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Service within the default namespace and cluster domain.

**3. Why can the client access the Service even if the backend Pod IPs change?**

It is because the Service dynamically updates its endpoints via selectors and EndpointSlices to track healthy Pod IPs automatically.

---

# Task 5 — Break and Restore the Label-Selector Contract

## Goal

Break the Service selector, observe that usable endpoints disappear, and then restore the correct selector.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — `02-nginx-svc-selector-broken.yaml` showing the incorrect selector

![](screenshots/Ass7sc9.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Empty endpoints or EndpointSlice output after applying the broken selector

![](screenshots/Ass7sc10.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Failed request output from the `tester` Pod

![](screenshots/Ass7sc11.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Restored endpoints and successful Service request

![](screenshots/Ass7sc12.JPG)

---

### Notes

**1. Why did the Service endpoints become empty?**

It is because no pods in the cluster matched the new swlwctor label app: does-not-match

**2. What caused the request from the client Pod to fail?**

The Service had no active backend endpoints to route the incoming traffic to.

**3. How did you restore connectivity to the NGINX Pods?**

By reapplying the original manifest (01-nginx-svc-clusterip.yaml) with the matching app: nginx selector.

---

# Task 6 — Observe How Readiness Affects Service Routing

## Goal

Observe how a new Pod that fails readiness is excluded from ready Service backends while the existing healthy Pod continues serving traffic.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Output showing the Deployment scaled to one ready Pod

![](screenshots/Ass7sc13.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Completed `03-readiness-broken.yaml` patch file

![](screenshots/Ass7sc14.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Output showing the expected incomplete rollout or NotReady Pod

![](screenshots/Ass7sc15.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — EndpointSlice output showing the healthy Pod with `ready: true` and the new NotReady Pod with `ready: false`

![](screenshots/Ass7sc16.JPG)

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Service EndpointSlice output showing ready backends after restoring the Deployment

![](screenshots/Ass7sc17.JPG)

---

### Notes

**1. Why was the new NotReady Pod excluded from ready Service backends?**

It is because Kubernetes services only route traffic to endpoints whose readiness probe conditions report ready: true.

**2. What is the relationship between readiness probes and Service routing?**

Readiness probes directly control endpoint inclusion; unready pods are immediately removed from service EndpointSlices.

**3. Why does this behavior protect users from unhealthy application instances?**

It ensures that live client requests are never dispatched to crashing, starting, or failing container
