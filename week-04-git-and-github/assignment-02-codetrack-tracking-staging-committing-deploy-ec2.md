# Assignment 2 — CodeTrack: Tracking, Staging, Committing + Deploy to EC2

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will track and stage project files, create two meaningful Git commits in `CodeTrack`, verify your commit history, and deploy the CodeTrack static website to an EC2 instance using Nginx. This connects local version-control practice with a basic manual deployment workflow used in real DevOps environments.

# Task 1 — Verify Git Setup and Enter the Repository

## Goal

Confirm that Git works and that you are inside the correct `CodeTrack` repository.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Create index.html and style.css

## Goal

Create the two starter UI files inside `CodeTrack`.

### Evidence

# Task 4 — Track and Stage Files Correctly

## Goal

Confirm both files show as untracked, then stage them individually with `git add`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `git status` showing both files as untracked

# Task 5 — Create the First Commit (Clean Initial Commit)

## Goal

Commit the staged starter files using the message `Initial UI scaffold: add index.html and style.css`, then check the log.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Output of `git commit`

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `git log --oneline` showing the first commit

# Task 6 — Modify index.html and Create a Second Commit

## Goal

Follow the instruction comment inside `index.html` to update the Student Name and Group Name, then commit that change separately using the message `Update homepage content: heading, tagline, CTA button`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Browser showing the updated page with your Student Name and Group Name visible
